                <p> Chamomile tea is most commonly known for its calming effects and is frequently used as a sleep aid. Two studies have examined the effects of chamomile tea or extract on sleep problems in humans. In one study of 80 postpartum women experiencing sleep issues, drinking chamomile tea for two weeks led to improved sleep quality and fewer symptoms of depression.</p>

                <p> Peppermint tea is one of the most commonly used herbal teas in the world. While it’s most popularly used to support digestive tract health, it also has antioxidant, anticancer, antibacterial and antiviral properties. Most of these effects have not been studied in humans, so it’s not possible to know if they might lead to health benefits. However, several studies have confirmed peppermint’s beneficial effects on the digestive tract. </p>

                <h2>Ginger Tea</h2>
                <img src="images/tea3.png" width="270" height="140" alt="" class="hboxthumb" />
                <p> Ginger tea is a spicy and flavorful drink that packs a punch of healthy, disease-fighting antioxidants. It also helps fight inflammation and stimulates the immune system, but it’s most well known for being an effective remedy for nausea. Studies consistently find that ginger is effective at relieving nausea, especially in early pregnancy, although it may also relieve nausea caused by cancer treatments and motion sickness. </p>

                <h2><a href="#">Hibiscis Tea</a></h2>
                <img src="images/tea4.png" width="270" height="140" alt="" class="hboxthumb" />
                <p> Hibiscus tea is made from the colorful flowers of the hibiscus plant. It has a pink-red color and refreshing, tart flavor. It can be enjoyed hot or iced. In addition to its bold color and unique flavor, hibiscus tea offers healthful properties. For example, hibiscus tea has antiviral properties, and test-tube studies have shown its extract to be highly effective against strains of the bird flu. However, no evidence has shown that drinking hibiscus tea could help you fight off viruses like the flu. </p>

                <p> Ginger is most commonly known as an herb for easing nausea and motion sickness. Research suggests that ginger may relieve the nausea caused by pregnancy and chemotherapy. Other areas under investigation in the use of ginger are in surgery and as an anticancer agent. </p>

                <p> Ginkgo leaf extract has been used to treat a variety of conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, fatigue, and tinnitus. It is also used to improve memory and to prevent dementia and other brain disorders. Some studies have supported its slight effectiveness. But exactly how gingko works isn't understood.</p>
